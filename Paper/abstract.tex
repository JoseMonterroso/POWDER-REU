Today's routing involves the 'message in a bottle' approach. In this approach we heavily rely on
routing tables to push packets towards the right destination. This leaves little to no control for
anyone to precisely direct traffic through an Autonomous System, let alone a neighboring
Autonomous system. Thus we would like to control network and security characteristics at 
endpoints across an interdomain environment.
In this paper we show how we used segment routing and BGP working at the 
data and control planes respectively to create a novel service specific routing 
framework for intra- and inter-domain network topologies.
