\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents a practical approach to network service specific routing
using BGP's large community attribute, SDN, and segment routing. Additionally,
it describes the design and implementation of the approach we take to provide
service specific routing on a three-AS topology. Our approach shows that we 
can achieve adequate service specific routing in the intra- and inter-domain
topologies without having to change much our defacto exterior gateway protocol:
BGP. Furthermore, we evaluate our new approach to the current routing system
and show just how useful service specific routing can be.
